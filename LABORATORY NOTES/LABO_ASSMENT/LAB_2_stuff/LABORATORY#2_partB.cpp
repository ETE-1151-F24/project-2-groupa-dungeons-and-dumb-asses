/*Description of the Problem #2
Write a program, which converts Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit. The user is supposed to
input Celsius temperature as a real value and your program should convert it to Fahrenheit as a
real number. Use the equation: F = 9.0/5.0 * C + 32.0 for conversion.
Sample Output<
Enter temperature in Celsius: 30.5
The temperature in Fahrenheit is 86.9
Post lab
A brief report is required due next week, containing source code, results, and about Â½ page
summary (single spaced) explaining what you learned in this lab.*/
